- [Layout 2][layout-2]
- [Layout 3][layout-3]

## ~~Find Theme With Material Guidance~~

- ~~[Material Guidance fro color][color]~~

## ~~Components~~

### ~~Header~~

#### ~~Prototype~~

- ~~take away hamburger menu~~

- ~~make AppBar match the theme's color~~

##### ~~Desktop View~~

- ~~Make it thinner.~~

### ~~Footer~~

#### ~~Prototype~~

- ~~Navigation UI in Footer.~~

- ~~fix width;~~

- ~~Change icons accordingly.~~
  ~~\* add an GitHub icon/link~~

##### ~~Add a store for Footer.state.value, with a Redux store, in order to be able to set all components to act according to the current navigation icon selected, and for screen swipes also change the navigatino icons.~~

- ~~[Create a Redux Store](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started)~~
- ~~[Connect Footer.js to Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/api/connect)~~
- ~~Understand [classes in material ui. Why it was passed as props to Footer.js](https://material-ui.com/#augmenting-your-props-using-withstyles)~~

- ~~[Handle actions>dispatch>reducer>scrolling to the right view](https://redux.js.org/basics/actions)~~

  - ~~Should I use [mapDispatchToProps](https://react-redux.js.org/api/connect#mapdispatchtoprops-object-dispatch-ownprops-object). I read that all data from store should be dispatched by actions (flux)~~
  - ~~Selected Footer tab should be determined by Redux's store~~

  - ###### **Objective:** Make sure both happen:

    - Clicking an BottomNavigationIcon scrolls to the top of the respective view
    - Scrolling/Swiping to a view will change BottomNavigation selected tab correspondingly
      - The Projects tab will be selected if window.screen doesn't exactly match the `window.screen` of the views of either the `Hero` or `Contact` components

  - ###### **Implementation:** So, basically, you'll be able to **either**:
    - ~~click button **-\>** changes `selectValue`'s redux state (`viewSelect` action) **-\>** goes to view (action that goes to the view onClick. **So**, add logic that moves to view into the `viewSelect` action).~~
    - ~~**TASK: create action/reducer**~~
    - ~~Going to a view by scrolling/swiping **-\>** also changes `selectValue`'s redux state, which **-\>** changes `BottomNavigation`'s value.~~
      - ~~Try [this](https://www.kempsterrrr.xyz/handling-scroll-events-in-react/) on desktop view, to see if App.onScroll works. using window.addEventListener('scroll') or setIntervall() makes slideshow and the whole app laggy.~~
      - ~~**Use [`window.pageYOffset`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/pageYOffset) (or [`window.scrollY`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/scrollY)), for [comparison](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22675126/what-is-offsetheight-clientheight-scrollheight).**~~
        - M~~aybe go to `/contact` after checking if pageYOffset >= (`method for whole app height` - `window.screen.availHeight`)~~
        - ~~Selected button matches view. Default selected button is `Projects`, if view not `top` or `contact` (**or default is `top`. If `!top` && `!contact`, is `project`**)~~
        - ~~**TASK: create action/reducer**~~

#### ~~Refinement~~

- ~~Change unselected navigation icons color to white, matching those on the AppBar~~

- ~~Pressing on the buttons should change view~~
  - ~~Replace the contact icon for one that doesn't give the idea of multiple contacts.~~

## Views

### View "/"

#### ~~Prototype~~

- ~~Choose start view's "/" image~~

#### Refinement

- ~~Only in this View, Switch Header and Footer component's background to '#00000090', else, back to '#2d5f72'~~

- ~~Choose Typography for Logo, and if it is gonna be only text or if there's gonna be a image for my brand.~~
- ~~`Scroll down` call to action should be a little further down.~~
- ~~Maybe add a redux store `Desktop | Mobile`, that, switches text between `Scroll | Swipe`~~
  - ~~Insted, solve it by using Hidden tags around spans for each word `scroll | swipe`.~~
- Change hero image, because the first one was in russian, and displays the hardware's logo, which could bring problems.

### View "/portfolio"

#### Refinement

- Choose which projects to display
- take screenshots of apps and replace images in the slideshow
- Change each slideshow's texto to the name and description of it's app.

### ~~View "/contact"~~

#### ~~Prototype~~

- ~~Draw Contact/Footer component.~~

- ~~Ready textField UI, with name, email and message fields.~~

- ~~Contact view should take 100% of view height~~
- ~~Links for Linkedin and Twitter? If there is, write it's names, icons are optional here.~~

#### ~~Refinement~~

##### ~~Implement functionality, so the form will send messages to my professional email.~~

- ~~See if it can be done with a 3rd party package or service.~~
- ~~Reset fields after send.~~
- ~~Methods:~~

  - **Method #1**: [Open OS Email Client, Filled By Form Input][emailclient]

    ```
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>

    <h2>Send e-mail to mail@ricardobossan.com:</h2>

    <form action="mailto:mail@ricardobossan.com" method="post" enctype="text/plain">
    Name:<br>
    <input type="text" name="name"><br>
    E-mail:<br>
    <input type="text" name="mail"><br>
    Comment:<br>
    <input type="text" name="comment" size="50"><br><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Send">
    <input type="reset" value="Reset">
    </form>

    </body>
    </html>
    ```

- **Method #2**: [Actions][mailaction]

### ~~Navigation ( BottomNavigation / Swiping / Scrolling)~~

#### Credits

[Handling scroll events in React - @kempsterrrr](https://www.kempsterrrr.xyz/handling-scroll-events-in-react/)

Navigate between component's views upon user input.

#### ~~Prototype~~

- ~~HashRouter not working as intended. It only uses a `#` in the address bar. Edit: Managed to get it working with [this tip, from Seth Kroger](https://teamtreehouse.com/community/reactrouter-hashrouter-does-not-work-with-2-routes)~~
- ~~Instead, add `id`s in the components, for navigation.~~
- ~~Create `<Link>`s on the Footer component, for navigating to the respective views~~

#### ~~Refinement~~

##### ~~Scrolling methodsMethods~~

###### ~~Method 1: -window.scrollTo(x,y)~~

```
/* pq cada componente tem 100vh, e portfolio Ã© o segundo componente. O primeiro  nÃ£o muda /*
/* Top */
window.scrollTo(0,0)
/* Portfolio */
window.scrollTo(0, (window.screen.availHeight) )
/* Contact */
window.scrollTo(0, (window.screen.availHeight*10) )
```

##### Unintended Behavior

- If swipe is long, it may hit Top or Bottom view without activating the action for selecting the respective view in the BottomNavigation bar. May be solved by adding a check at `scrollY === 0` and `scrolly >= window.scrollHeight - window.screen.availHeight -1`. Add a setTimeout for 1000ms, so it won't call too many times.

## ~~Tablet (width>=1024px && width <1366px) breakpoint~~

- ~~social should be closer to each other~~.
- ~~Slideshows should wrap~~.

## ~~Desktop breakpoint~~

- ~~Decide design. Between:~~
  - ~~Using css breakpoints and material ui theme breakpoints~~
  - ~~Creating a **redux store for switching between Desktop and Mobile** (or also between tablet and phone) view, when `App` Component `onResize` is triggered, to displaying, hiding or modifying accordingly things that show on the screen.~~
  - ~~:point_right: Both approaches (CSS Breakpoints in material UI && redux state for phone, tablet and desktop, for eventual features):point_left:~~
- ~~Hide bottom navigation~~
  - ~~Switch it's functionality to a :point_right: left aside or top the center of the Top App Bar, without icons.~~

### ~~Prototype~~

- ~~Hide componet `Footer / NavigationBottom`.~~
- ~~And replace it by mounting a left `<aside>`, or material ui equivalent component.~~
  - ~~Use [secondary, in themes][muithemes], for styling selected tab in `<aside>`~~
    - ~~Use this JSS in the class, and make it be the iten's style when the redux state matches that item (found in [Mui docs for MenuItem][menuitem]):~~

```
  '&:focus': {
      backgroundColor: theme.palette.primary.main,
      '& $primary, & $icon': {
        color: theme.palette.common.white,
      },
    },
```

    - ~~Check [tutorial][muithemetutorial]~~

- ~~`<aside>` should have the same functionality as the Footer~~

### ~~Refinement~~

- ~~Do some styling to diferentiate the current view, so it won't be boring and so it is good looking~~.

## General Refinement

### Social Icons Send User to My Social Profiles ðŸ‘ˆ

- Header mail icon goes to the right view, but doesn't change BottomNavigation selected tab, like it's not connected to Redux. On Redux DevTools, no action is dispatched, when clicked on the icon
  - Got to either fix lack of connection between Header and Redux, or simply get rid of the mail icon.

### Mobile View Screen Sometimes Horizontaly Seems Swiped a Single Px Out of Bounds

## Finalize

- Create a full sketch of react-redux functionality

## Future Improvements

- Form validation for email TextField.
- [Use Refs for DOM](https://codesandbox.io/s/v6948pww5y?from-embed)
- [Use react hooks with redux, to have global state with functional components](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-integrate-react-hooks-into-your-project-without-changing-your-redux-code-974e6f70f0b0?source=bookmarks---------0---------------------)

* Type (light /dark theme)
  You can make the theme dark by setting type to dark. While it's only a single property value change, internally it modifies the value of the following keys:

```
palette.text
palette.divider
palette.background
palette.action
const theme = createMuiTheme({
  palette: {
    type: 'dark',
  },
});
```
